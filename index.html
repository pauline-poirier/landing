		<h2>My story</h2>
		<p>
	 My name is Pauline. I have always loved to travel around the world and explore different cuisines. I have been a vegetarian for years but often found it challenging to find delicious vegetarian options while traveling in different countries. 
	 After returning from a trip to India where I discovered amazing vegetarian dishes, I decided that I wanted to share my love for vegetarian cuisine from around the world with others. 
	 I worked hard to research and develop recipes that were authentic, easy to make, and used ingredients that were widely available. I wanted to make it easy for people to explore and enjoy new flavors and cuisines from every continent without having to leave their own kitchens.
	And this is how the Veggie Passeport was created ! </p>

      		<h3>The vegetarian Paella from Spain</h3>
      		<p>Heat 1 tbsp oil in a large frying pan and cook an onion and a garlic clove for 5 minutes, until softened.

Bring to the boil and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add 150g runner beans, sliced on an angle, pepper and 210g of tin chickpeas and cook for another 10 minutes. Squeeze over the juice of a lemon and scatter with the parsley. 
      		Serve with some extra lemon wedges on the side to squeeze over, if you like.</p>

      		<h3>Lecsó from Hungary</h3>
      		<p>In a pot, sauté 2 thinly sliced onions in vegetable oil over low heat, stirring frequently, until translucent. Do not let them burn. Salt lightly to help tenderize them. Add a small amount of water, if necessary, to keep them from sticking to the pan.
      		Add 6 cubed tomatoes, cover and simmer for 5 minutes. Add 4 yellow wax peppers (cut into medium sized pieces) and 1 teaspoon of sweet paprika powder, sprinkle with ground black pepper and cook for another 5-8 minutes.

      		<h3>Dovlecei Pane from Romania</h3>
      		<p>Slice 4 zucchini into 1 cm thick discs and pat dry using a dish towel.
      		Combine 100 grams of flour and 1 tsp of polenta in a shallow dish. Place an egg beaten in a separate dish.
      		Heat 60 ml of oil in a frying pan over high heat. Working in small batches, dip the zucchini slices in the flour, then the egg. Carefully place in the oil and fry for 2 minutes on each side, then set aside on paper towels to drain any excess oil. Repeat with the remaining slices.
      		Seaon the fritters with salt and pepper and serve on a plate with a generous drizzle of garlic sauce and a sprinkle of parsley- perfect for a lunch-time snack.</p>

		<h2>From Asia...</h2>
		
      <div class="row">
      <img src="images/chana.jpg" alt="Chana masala" width="200px"style="float:left";>
    
      		<h3>Chana masala from India</h3>
      		<p>In a large saucepan, warm 2tsp of oil over medium heat. Add an onion, serrano and salt. Cook until the onion is tender and turning translucent. Add 5 cloves of garlic and 1 tsp of ginger, and cook until fragrant. Stir in the garam masala, coriander, cumin, turmeric, salt and cayenne.
      		Add a can of fire-roasted crushed tomatoes. Raise the heat to medium-high and add 2 cans of chickpeas. Bring the mixture to a simmer. Cook for at least 10 minutes.
      	Serve over basmati rice, if desired, and garnish with a lemon wedge or two and a sprinkle of fresh cilantro leaves.</p>

      		<h3>Shakshuka from Israel</h3>
      		<p>Dice an onion and red bell pepper and add that to a sauté pan with a little olive oil on medium heat. Stir the veggies for about 5 minutes or until the onions become translucent.
      		Then add the garlic and spices and stir for another minute until they’re nice and fragrant. Pour in a 28-ounce can of whole peeled tomatoes and use your spatula to break up the tomatoes into smaller pieces. Once this entire mixture is lightly simmering, you can crack your eggs on top. Use your spatula to make little holes for the eggs, then crack an egg into each hole. I used 6 eggs, though depending on the size of your pan you may use more or less. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pan and cook for another 5-8 minutes or until the eggs are done to your liking.
      		Before serving, season the eggs with salt and a generous amount of freshly chopped parsley and cilantro. </p>

      		<h3>Veggie spring rolls from China</h3>
      		<p>Soak the rice noodles in cold water for 15 mins until pliable, then drain. Meanwhile, combine a Chinese leaf cabbage, 2 carrots, 150g of bean sprouts and the whites of 3 spring onions in a large bowl. Heat the sesame oil in a large pan and tip in the cabbage mixture. Add 2tps of soy sauce and Shaoxing wine. Cook until reduced slightly and add the drained noodles, coriander, and green parts of the spring onion. Transfer to a plate and spread out to cool slightly.
      		Then, arrange a spring roll wrapper on your worktop in a diamond shape. Place a heaped tablespoon onto the middle of the pastry in a sausage shape. Bring up the bottom corner of the pastry and fold over the top corner. Bring over the pastry from the left side over the top of the filling and roll into shape, making sure the ends stay tucked in. Seal the final corner with a little water.
      		Heat the vegetable oil in a large, deep pan to 180°C. Cook the spring rolls in batches for 4-5 mins until golden.Transfer to a baking sheet and keep warm in a low oven while you continue to fry. Serve the spring rolls with a spicy dipping sauce or some sweet chilli sauce. </p>
